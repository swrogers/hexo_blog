## Things I've been trying to learn

I've had a handful of items over the past number of years that I've been trying to work on and learn - or learn better. Javascript has been one of them, and I've taken a few jabs and shots at it, using various Udemy courses. I would say that I've gotten to where I generally don't mind Javascript, though it was definitely a different way of thinking from any other style of programming that I already knew.

From there, I've decided that I really do enjoy Angular - so along with that comes the need to also learn Typescript, which I think brings a lot to the table alongside the mother language of Javascript. With Angular, I do like the opinionation of it - batteries included so to speak. To me, it was a lot like Django on the python side, all inclusive in one nicely wrapped package, though you could use other ideas if you wanted.

Currently, I'm attempting to learn Ionic on top of Angular. Why? Because I kind of like the idea of not only a nice web app or progressive web app, but that the interface looks really good on whatever device it's loaded on. Is it likely that I'd ever actually build an "application" out of something? No, but I like that I could.

## Tutorial Hell

Yep. I'm kind of in that spot. I haven't really decided what my "itch" would be that would get me to veer off and create something. I suppose that one could go on and create a clone of twitter or instagram - which I may probably do. But the world has enough "to do" lists and task boards, we don't really need another one of those. 

It also doesn't help that my design chops kind of suck, so no matter what I do build it's going to have to stand on the basis that its backend is purely mine.
