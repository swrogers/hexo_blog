### So I've got this blog thing set up. Again.

Yep. Will this be the time that I'm able to blog consistenty? Most likely not. At least this time I'm not running something that will be difficult to keep going - a hexo static site pushed to github and hosted on netlify. 

Something simple to get up and running, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

But still, there is always a cost or barrier to entry, and that - for me - would be the need to have a good mobile interface. Who wants to have to sit at a computer or laptop and write these days? Especially after having to be at one for work for 8 plus hours a day?

Not I, said he.

So, yeah, this will probably fester and die like most every other blog site that I've attempted to set up. Well, not most, all.
